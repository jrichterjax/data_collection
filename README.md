# data_collection

In this challenge, data is scraped from two sites which contain Mars news and Mars weather information.  

Part 1 scrapes the text elements from the Mars news site and stores the title and preview taxt in a list of dictionaries.

Part 2 scrapes all data from the Mars weather site and stores the data in a Pandas Dataframe. Using the stored data, the following questions are answered:

- How many months are there on Mars?
- How many Martian days' worth of data are there?
- What is the average low temperature by month?
- What are the coldest and hottest months in Curiosity's location?
- What is the average pressure by Martian month?
- How many terrestrial (earth) days are there in a Martian year?
